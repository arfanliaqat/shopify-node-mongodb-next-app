## TO-DO

- [ ] Add a check to ensure if the merchant cancels on the subscription page, they're either taken back to their store or back to pricing page. The current setup allows the merchant to use the app if they click on cancel.
- [ ] External pricing page.
---
- [ ] Better Templates.
- [ ] Refactor Code.
- [ ] Better sessions handling.
---
- [ ] Switch to `@apollo/client`
  - While the current setup with `apollo/boost` works, the Apollo community seems to have moved to `@apollo/client` package.
- [ ] Babel.
---
- [ ] Documentation.
- [ ] One click deploy to Heroku.

### Long Term
- [ ] TypeScript version.
- [ ] Pure Next.js version.

- [ ] A variant that uses GraphQL server instead of Koa.
  - Reminder: Check if it's actually possible, because it looks like it can be.
- [ ] Extensions.
- [ ] Emotional Stability.
