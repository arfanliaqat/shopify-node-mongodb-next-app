## TO-DO

### In Progress

- [ ] Add a check to ensure if the merchant cancels on the subscription page, they're either taken back to their store or back to pricing page. The current setup allows the merchant to use the app if they click on cancel.

### Up Next

- [ ] Refactor code.
- [ ] Switch to `@apollo/client`

- [ ] Documentation.
- [ ] Tests (Jest and Cypress).
