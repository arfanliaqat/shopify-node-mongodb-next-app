## TO-DO

- [ ] Subscription and Uninstall management from the app.
  - While subscription management is a common thing, uninstall management would allow the merchant to remove all the app injected code in the store to ensure your app isn't blamed for slowing down stores.
---
- [ ] Add a check to ensure if the merchant cancels on the subscription page, they're either taken back to their store or back to pricing page. The current setup allows the merchant to use the app if they click on cancel.
- [ ] External pricing page.
---

- [ ] Refactor Code.
- [ ] Better sessions handling.
---
- [ ] Documentation.
